# Example Scientific Post

This is an example of a scientific blog post that includes LaTeX formulae.

## The Pythagorean Theorem

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of squares of the other two sides. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

$$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$

Where:
- $a$ and $b$ are the lengths of the two sides adjacent to the right angle
- $c$ is the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle)

## Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence

One of the most famous equations in physics is Einstein's mass-energy equivalence:

$$E = mc^2$$

Where:
- $E$ is energy
- $m$ is mass
- $c$ is the speed of light in vacuum

This equation demonstrates the fundamental relationship between mass and energy in the universe.

## The Schrödinger Equation

In quantum mechanics, the Schrödinger equation is a fundamental equation that describes how the quantum state of a physical system changes with time:

$$i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \hat H \Psi(\mathbf{r},t)$$

Where:
- $i$ is the imaginary unit
- $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant
- $\Psi$ is the wave function of the quantum system
- $\hat H$ is the Hamiltonian operator

These are just a few examples of how LaTeX can be used to display complex mathematical formulae in our scientific blog posts.
